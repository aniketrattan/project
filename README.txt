The main menu of the game gives the players three options to choose from. These options are Encounter, Campsite and Shop. The players will use keyboard input keys to access these options.

Once in the encounter, the players will be alloted action points to them which will be used to perform different abilities. Each ability costs 1 action point. Once the player is done with the attacks, they have to press 0 to end the round. Action points reset after every round.

There are total 3 monsters to defeat. The difficulty of the game increases with each encounter. The minion can only attack a single character whereas the miniboss and boss can attack 2 and 3 characters respectively. The players will earn gold from killing the monsters.

After each encounter, the characters are returned to the campsite to restore their health. They can also access the shop where they can purchase items from the gold they earned.
